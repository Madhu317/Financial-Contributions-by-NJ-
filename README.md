# Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploration of Financial Contributions to United States Presedential Campaign of 2016 by the State of New Jersey Using R

This is a a Project focussed on perfoming exploratory data analysis as a part of Udacity's nanodegree.

I chose to explore the city of New Jersey.New Jersey is considered a blue state/Democratic state, I thought it would be interesting to do a fact checking and explore the financial contibution by the people of New Jersey to the candidates and party. 

The project is split into the following analysis:

-Univariate
-Bivariate 
-Multivariate 

This was a very helpful method to think about questions and answer them in the flow of the project. 

Univariate analysis helped figure out trends in different variables.To answer the questions formed with univariate analysis, the Bivariate analysis helped me figure out a good flow to get the best way to analyze variable pairs. Finally Multivariate analysis helped put togther the variables from univariate and bivariate analysis and yield a final explanation of the contribution spread.
